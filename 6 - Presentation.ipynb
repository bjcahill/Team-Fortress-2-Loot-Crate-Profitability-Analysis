    "\n",
    "- A couple times a year Valve adds a new crate. These crates contain cosmetic items you can wear on your characters, such as new hats or jackets. \n",
    "- Crates work like traditional loot boxes or booster packs. Each crate contain one randomized item, and in order to \"unbox\" it, a player must buy a \"key\" from the in-game store for approximatly $2.50. Each key works on only one crate and is then consumed. (This is how the game is monitized by Valve.)\n",
    "- Most items in crates are worth less than fifty cents. However, you have an approximatly 1% chance to unbox an **unusual** item, an item with a rare particle effect surrounding it. These items can be worth anywhere from 10 dollars to 6,000 dollars."

Once an unusual sells, it is priced at that amount on the community website **backpack.tf**, priced using the in-game currency of keys (the same keys you use to unbox crates). Since each key costs 2.50, an unusual priced at 10 keys would be worth roughly 25 dollars. An unusual priced at 100 keys would be worth 250 dollars, and so on."

While I knew `Price` and `Effect Community Rating` were going to be crucial for machine learning, I realized quickly that `Months Since Last Price Update` had no correlation to anything else in the dataset, leaving the dataset filled with 2 quantitative variables and almost 10 categorical variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortionatly, this large amount of categorical variables turned out to significantly hamper the performance of any K-Nearest Neighbors models I ran on the data. This was because there were some rare cosmetics in the dataset with only a few priced unusuals, causing KKN to fail to find enough reasonable neighbhors. For example, if I used a larger value of k such as 20 (which was important for predicting low value unusuals) and tried to predict the price of a cosmetic with only 5 priced unusuals, the model would find those 5 neigbhors and then grab 15 other neighbors that were quite a bit \"further away\", simply because it couldn't compare variables such as `Name` or `Effect` very well and wouldn't be able to find the \"next best\" neighbors.\n",

    "To define `Median Hat Rating`, I found the median value of each unusual **effect** and merged this data as an additional column in the dataset. Next, I took the difference between the price of each unusual and it's effect's median price, yeilding me a postive or negative value depending on if the unusual was priced higher than the median value for that effect. Using these numbers, I then  grouped all of these values by their **cosmetic (hat)** and took the median of these values. This yeilded me values for each cosmetic that were either positive or negative. A positive value indicated that each of the cosmetic's effects were higher than the average (thus better!), and a negative value indicated that each of each of the cosmetic's effects were lower than the average (thus worse). This gave me a tier order distinguishing the best cosmetics from the worst ones. \n",

    "In 2015, Valve added an additional rarity system to crate-based items. Instead of every item having the same underlying rarity, there became four distinct rarities (called **grades**), **Mercenary**, **Commando**, **Assassin** and **Elite**. When unboxing a crate, you have about an **80%** chance of getting a **Mercenary** item, a **15%** chance of getting a **Commando** item, a **3%** chance of getting an **Assassin** item, and a **0.6%** chance of getting an elite item. When you remember that you have a **1%** chance of unboxing an unusual in the first place, it follows that the chance to pull an **unusual elite grade** item is 0.01 * 0.006 or as low as **0.006%!** As such, there are barley any **elite** items in existance (and subsequently in the dataset). The plot above reflects these rarities in the price of each item, as **Mercenary** grade items tend to be fairly cheap compared to **Assassin** and **Elite** grade items. \n",

You can also tell that Valve has added few miscs to the game since 2015, as there are only a few **Commando** grade miscs and no miscs of any other grade."
